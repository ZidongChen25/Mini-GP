# MiniGP
MiniGP is a minimalistic Gaussian Process (GP) library focused on regression tasks. It is designed to be simple and easy to understand. 

Despite that there are many successful GP libraries, such as GPy, GPflow, and Pyro, they are often too complex for beginners to understand. Things get worse when the user wants to customize the model. MiniGP is designed to be simple and easy to understand. It is a great tool for educational purposes. We also try to make it easy for anyone to use without a lot of background knowledge of GP.

## Installation
We do not have a pip package yet. You can install it by cloning the repository and rune the code for your own purpose. At this stage we think it is better to keep it simple and customizable. It servers as rather demo code than a library, with some useful functions to make computation easier.

## Structure
- **core:** This folder contains all the core functions for Gaussian Processes (GP). It serves as the backbone of the library. Additionally, it includes Python scripts for GP models that are designed to be easy and quick to use for research and experimentation. The folder also contains a model comparison script and the corresponding results. More details can be found in the README file within the core folder.
