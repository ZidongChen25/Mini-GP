# MiniGP
MiniGP is a minimalistic Gaussian Process (GP) library. It is designed to be simple and easy to understand. 

Despite that there are many successful GP libraries, such as GPy, GPflow, and Pyro, they are often too complex for beginners to understand. Things get worse when the user wants to customize the model. MiniGP is designed to be simple and easy to understand. It is a great tool for educational purposes. We also try to make it easy for anyone to use without a lot of background knowledge of GP.

## Installation
We do not have a pip package yet. You can install it by cloning the repository and rune the code for your own purpose. At this stage we think it is better to keep it simple and customizable. It servers as rather demo code than a library, with some useful functions to make computation easier.

## Structure

# Log

## 2024-06-28
- New structure for the project
- add SGP model
- add model_FAQ

## 2024-02-21
- Adding demo
- add gp_computation_pack to handle all common computation in GP
- add new gp models

## 2023-11-26
Code refactored with New architecture!
- using modual kernel. No more parameter passing. When a kernel is initialized, it will automatically create the parameters it needs. User can easily define their own way of creating kernels.
- new GP will use two key components: kernel and mean function. The likelihood tied to the GP and not spedified by the user. A GP model should have it own likelihood function.
